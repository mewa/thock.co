  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to obtain the switches separately?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> No, a set of electro-capacitive switches is included as part of the kit. Circumventing the need to buy $300+ Topre keyboards just to salvage them for parts has been a core goal from day one.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What layouts are supported?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Both grid and MIT layouts are supported. The plate has a 2u cutout that can accomodate either a single 2u switch or two 1u switches.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What is the expected date of shipment?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Q3 2021 &ndash; or sooner if the schedule allows.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does it support MX-style keycaps?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the sliders support MX-style keycaps &ndash; you can use all your favorite keycaps. Topre-style keycaps are not supported.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does the kit contain a keycap set?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> No, keycaps are not included.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it so expensive?</em></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> This is the first keyboard to provide a fully custom, programmable, electro-capacitive experience. Bringing this keyboard to life required years of research, prototyping and firmware development. Setting up a whole new branch of keyboards requires significant investments. In order to enable future EC projects, profits from this Group Buy are going to fund these investments.</p>
