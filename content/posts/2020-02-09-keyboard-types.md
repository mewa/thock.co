The first thing before buying a mechanical keyboard is to realize in
what ways it is different from a "standard" keyboard. Or rather the
most widely used. Let's review them, regardless.

By far, the most prevalent keyboard design is the so-called "rubber
dome". It's a variation of a membrane keyboard -- which in turn is
often found in household appliances, such as microwaves.

Membrane keyboards consist of two layers sandwiched together and a
little spacing in-between them. The bottom layer has (unconnected)
conductive traces, while the top layer has a conductive pad that
bridges those traces together when pressed against the bottom
layer. Typically they are flat and have no tactile feedback.

Rubber dome keyboards are different in this regard in that the top
layer is usually molded out of rubber or silicone and protrudes from
the baseline. This results in the keys receiving a meaningful
height. Moreover, due to the rubber domes collapsing on each keystroke
such keyboards have perceptible tactile feedback.

Both flat and rubber dome membrane keyboards are very cheap to
manufacture due to having a very small amount of components
required. Most rubber dome keyboards only consist of a PCB (Printend
Circuit Board) that houses the conductive traces and a rubber dome
sheet with carbon pads.

However, there's a huge drawback to all membrane keyboards -- they
require the user to fully depress the key to register the
keystroke. This results in hindered typing speed but also finger
fatigue accumulating over time.  
Rubber dome keyboards also suffer from the fact that they are
optimized for cheap mass-production and as a result tend to have what
is described as rather "mushy" (and inconsistent) feeling to it.

Some of of the more advanced rubber dome designs such as the scissor
or butterfly switch incorporate additional interlocking plastic
elements that stabilize the key and reduce key travel distance. They
are sligthly more expensive and mostly found in laptops -- although
they are arguably the best switches found in membrane
keyboards. However, due to the reduced key travel they're almost
exclusively used in low-profile keyboards. Like every membrane switch
they need to bottom out for the key code to register.

There's a lot more that could be said about membrane keyboards, but
since it's a segment that doesn't cater to conscious users there isn't
really any incentive to do so. The information conveyed so far should
be enough to have a fairly deep understanding of how mechanical
keyboards and switches are different -- and that's something that will
be covered in part II.
