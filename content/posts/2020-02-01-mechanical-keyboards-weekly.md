Keyboards are one of those everyday appliances most people don't pay a
lot of attention to. Most people use them on an "as-is" basis -- be it
the keyboard built-in to your laptop or the first thing you grabbed at
the store. And that's totally fine if you only spend a limited amount
of time using them.

However, in XXIth century that is not the case for a whole lot of
people. We spend a significant amount of time in front of our
computers, hence in my opinion it makes sense to optimize for the best
experience. If you're not convinced come to think of it this way:

> If you were a lumberjack would you rather use a hand saw or a
chainsaw?

Even if you think that's not something you're going to need I think
it's good to at least _consider_ the options.  
However, the fact remains -- the recent revival of interest in
mechanical keyboards (or should I say _renaissance_?) is a thing.

Not long time ago I would have never imagined myself investing so much
time and effort into creating an enjoyable typing experience. I was
using a plain gamer keyboard by Steelseries and I was feeling totally
fine with it.

But at some point I decided to make a switch. And here's why: the
nature of my work dictates that I spend a lot of time in front of the
computer -- and I've come to realize that keyboard is a _tool_ I use
to make this work happen. Therefore, I decided to pick a tool that's
right for the job. A tool that will allow me to be more efficient -- I
decided not to use a "hand saw".

When I first digged into mechanical keyboards I was pretty green, like
everyone else. But I've learnt a lot about keyboards since then. In
this series I'm going to share a lot about my personal experience
regarding mechanical keyboards, what things there are to consider when
buying one as well as some interesting things that are happening in
this field.
